# TestForge: Vision and PRD for the Next-Gen Test Case Management Platform

## Objective

Build an enterprise-grade, highly scalable test case management tool (“TestForge”) that is intuitive and uniquely user-friendly, addressing the needs of large QA teams with clear, powerful workflows. It must consolidate test planning, execution, and reporting in one system, integrate seamlessly with DevOps pipelines and issue trackers, and support manual and automated testing. We will prioritise a clean, modern UX and advanced features (e.g. AI-assisted generation) while adhering to rigorous best practices for code quality, security, and scalability.

## User Personas and Use Cases

- **QA Engineers/Testers**: Everyday users who create and execute test cases. They need a centralized repository of reusable test cases, rich editing (e.g. WYSIWYG/rich-text test case authoring), and tools for both manual and automated runs. They value simplicity and clear status tracking.
- **Test Leads/Managers**: Oversee test planning and track progress. They require high-level dashboards, reports (burndown charts, pass/fail rates, defect detection efficiency), and the ability to organise test cycles and assign tasks. They rely on traceability linking requirements to tests and bugs for audit and risk assessment.
- **Developers/DevOps**: Integrate testing with the CI/CD pipeline. They use TestForge to get fast feedback on code quality. They need tight integrations with Git repos, issue trackers (e.g. Jira/GitHub), CI tools, and test automation frameworks. They expect an API/SDK for integration (e.g. to trigger test runs or fetch test status).
- **Product Owners/Stakeholders**: Consume high-level analytics and reports. They need clear metrics (coverage, quality trends) and compliance evidence for regulated environments. The tool must offer configurable dashboards and role-based views so they see only what’s relevant.
- **Security/Compliance Officers**: Ensure data protection and audit trails. They need role-based access control (RBAC), encryption of data, and logging/audit capabilities.

These personas cover large-team workflows where collaboration and transparency are key. TestForge will empower each role with tailored features (e.g. test templates for QAs, scheduling for project managers, granular RBAC for security, analytics for executives).

## Core Features and Differentiators

Based on industry best practice, TestForge must include all standard test management capabilities, with added innovation:

- **Centralized Test Repository & Execution**: Organise and manage test cases in a unified library with folders/tags/sprints. Supports manual execution and automated runs with pass/fail/blocked statuses. Manage test plans and milestones (templates for schedules/milestones).
- **Traceability & Requirements Linking**: Full end-to-end linking: map tests to requirements/user stories and defects. This ensures coverage and risk analysis (a “requirement–risk linkage” per modern QA tools). Reports should highlight untested requirements and defective areas.
- **Real-time Reporting & Analytics**: Interactive dashboards showing progress, burndown charts, pass/fail rates, and defect trends. Customizable reports allow filtering by project, tester, time period, etc. Built-in analytics (coverage heatmaps, DDE metric, etc.) help managers make data-driven decisions.
- **Integrations & Automation**: Seamless integration with issue trackers (Jira, GitHub Issues), CI/CD pipelines, version control, and test frameworks. This includes automatic creation of defects from failed tests, importing requirements from a spec, and support for plugin hooks or webhooks. We will provide an open REST/GraphQL/RPC API and/or SDK for custom integrations.
- **Collaboration & Workflow**: In-app comments, tagging, and assignment for test cases and runs. Real-time updates and notifications (e.g. via Slack, email) keep the team in sync. We emphasise a logical, guided workflow that balances structure with flexibility. For example, test runs flow from creation through execution to closure, with clear steps and approvals.
- **Customization & Flexibility**: Allow custom fields, statuses, workflows, and templates to adapt to each team’s processes. Support reusability (test case libraries and duplication) so common tests can be cloned across projects. Flexible scheduling (bulk edits, import/export) reduces admin tasks.
- **Intuitive UX**: A clean, modern interface with minimal learning curve. Key principles include: searchable, filterable tables; drag-and-drop where useful; dark mode and responsive design. Personalised dashboards let users pin their most-used modules. TestForge will invest in a user-centric design: contextual help, keyboard shortcuts, and easy navigation as seen in top QA tools.
- **AI-powered Assistance**: Unique among many tools, TestForge will incorporate AI aids. For example, smart test-case suggestions (drawing on historical cases or specifications), automated generation of boilerplate test steps, and flaky-test detection support. Other products (e.g. QMetry) already offer generative AI features like intelligent search and automatic test case generation; we will differentiate by integrating LLMs for summarizing test results or suggesting improvements.
- **Rich Editing and Reporting**: Support rich text formatting (tables, code snippets) in test case descriptions and results. Exportable reports (PDF/Excel) and email summaries are built-in. Draw inspiration from tools like Tuskr, which emphasize a user-friendly interface for authoring and reporting.
- **Scalability & Performance**: Architected for enterprise load: thousands of users, millions of test steps. Sharding or multi-tenant design as needed. Employ caching and pagination on lists. “The tool should scale with team growth”, supporting concurrent users and large test suites without lag.
- **Security & Compliance**: Enterprise security features: RBAC (user roles, project-based permissions), single sign-on (SAML/OAuth2), and audit logs. Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Consider GDPR compliance (data retention policies, user data export). For regulated industries, support configurable retention and access controls.
- **Extensibility**: Provide a plugin or scripting system (webhooks, custom fields, REST API) so enterprises can extend TestForge. E.g. custom connectors for proprietary systems. A robust API ensures TestForge can become the single source of truth without locking data in.

These features align with “must-have” traits of modern test tools. The differentiators are the emphasis on UI/UX excellence, AI enhancements, and frictionless integration. Combined, TestForge will let teams focus on testing rather than tool management.

## Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: We choose TanStack Start (React) as a modern full-stack framework. It provides SSR/streaming rendering, type-safe routing, and API routes. With this, we build a TypeScript-based single-page application that pre-renders content on the server for speed/SEO and hydrates on the client.
- **Routing & State**: Use TanStack Router for nested, type-safe routes. Leverage TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching and caching, ensuring UI stays snappy. Both TanStack Start and Query are TypeScript-first, so the frontend will have end-to-end type safety with the backend.
- **UI Layer**: A design system (e.g. Tailwind CSS for styling and custom components) ensures consistency. Possibly use an existing component library (Material UI or similar) for rich controls (data tables, charts, dialogs). Tailwind integration is supported out-of-the-box. We’ll follow an atomic CSS / component-driven approach so UI elements are reusable and themeable.
- **API Calls**: Frontend will call backend APIs via TanStack Start’s server functions or API routes. These are built-in endpoints (in the same codebase) that run on the server; they offer RPC-style calls with no separate Express server needed. This allows sharing types (via treaty/Eden) for parameters. For example, creating a test case calls a server function like `POST /api/tests`.
- **Authentication**: Implement auth using a provider like Clerk or Auth.js integrated into TanStack Start (examples exist in docs). Alternatively, use our own OAuth2/JWT flow. Given enterprise use, we’ll likely support SSO (SAML/OAuth2) for companies, as well as email/password for others. The frontend enforces role-based UI (hiding admin features from regular users).
- **Client-side Testing**: Use Vitest or Jest for unit tests of UI components and utilities. All frontend code will have 100% type coverage and linting (ESLint/Prettier). Use React Testing Library for component tests. For E2E, use Playwright (or Cypress) with the deployed app to script user scenarios (login, create test, run suite). These tests will run in CI.

TanStack Start’s deploy-anywhere nature means we can choose hosting with a minimal cost. It even supports static/CDN deployment if needed. In future, we can separately deploy frontend on a global CDN (enhancing performance for dispersed teams).

## Backend Architecture

- **Framework**: Use Elysia (TypeScript on Bun) for the backend. Elysia is a new high-performance framework that provides built-in type-safety and low overhead. It functions similarly to Fastify or Express but leverages Bun’s speed. Crucially, Elysia can generate OpenAPI schemas and provides an RPC-like interface via treaty/Eden for end-to-end typing.
- **API Design**: We will design a RESTful or RPC API covering all needs: test cases, runs, users, projects, etc. With Elysia’s type-safe routes, we declare input/output schemas (using TypeBox) to validate and document automatically. For example, creating a test case might have a TypeBox schema defining `{title: string, steps: string[], projectId: string}`. This ensures requests are validated and typed in both client and server. We will generate an OpenAPI spec for each version.
- **Database**: A relational database (e.g. PostgreSQL) suits structured data and complex queries. We can use Drizzle ORM with TypeScript (it has Elysia integration) to define schema in code. Drizzle schemas can be converted to Elysia validation models for end-to-end safety (see Elysia/Drizzle integration). As an example, a `test_case` table might have columns (`id`, `title`, `description`, `project_id`, `status`, etc). For attachments, we could use an object store (S3/MinIO) and save URLs in the DB.
- **Microservices / Modularity**: Initially, a single Elysia service handles everything. In a monorepo, we might keep front and back in one codebase for simplicity (with sub-packages). The backend code will be well-modularised: separate modules for Auth, Test Cases, Reporting, Analytics, etc. Later, services could be split (e.g. a separate analytics service) if needed.
- **Observability**: Elysia has built-in OpenTelemetry support. We will instrument all endpoints and possibly database queries. Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana or a hosted APM (New Relic, DataDog) for real-time monitoring. Also use structured logging (e.g. Pino logger) with correlation IDs to trace requests.
- **Caching & Performance**: Use Redis or in-memory caching for heavy queries (e.g. frequently accessed dashboards). Elysia can easily integrate Redis plugins. Rate-limit critical endpoints to prevent abuse. Ensure proper indexing in the DB (especially for filtering test cases by project/status/etc).
- **Security**: Implement JWT or session auth on backend. Roles (admin, manager, tester) govern API access. Follow OWASP guidelines: sanitize all input, use parameterized queries (ORM helps here), enforce HTTPS, helmet (even on Bun if possible). Encrypt sensitive data (e.g. user passwords) with bcrypt. Keep dependencies up-to-date.
- **Testing**: Backend code will have comprehensive tests using Bun’s built-in test runner. Elysia’s “treaty” allows end-to-end type-safe tests. For example, we can spin up a test server and use `treaty(app)` to invoke API routes and assert responses at compile-time. We will write unit tests for business logic (e.g. validation, report calculations) and integration tests hitting the real DB (using a test database).

Overall, both front and back will adhere to clean code and layering: e.g. controllers/services/repositories, dependency injection for testability, etc. Continuous refactoring and code reviews (via PRs) will enforce standards.

## DevOps, Deployment, and CI/CD

- **Monorepo Structure**: As a solo dev and to facilitate type-sharing, use a monorepo (e.g. with Nx or Turborepo) containing the frontend and backend packages. This allows one pipeline and shared configurations (lint, prettier, TS, CI). It also eases refactoring (rename a shared type once, updates everywhere). However, ensure well-defined boundaries (frontend code vs backend code) and possibly use Yarn workspaces or pnpm for dependencies.
- **Containerization**: Each service (frontend and backend) will be containerized with Docker. The Dockerfile for the frontend will run a production build (`vite build` via TanStack CLI) and serve static assets (or Node SSR). The backend Dockerfile will run on Bun (e.g. `FROM oven/bun`), installing dependencies and running the Elysia app. Use multi-stage builds to keep images small. We can orchestrate with Docker Compose for local dev (Postgres, Redis, services).
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Use GitHub Actions for automated builds. Key jobs:
  - **Lint & Type Check**: Run ESLint, Prettier check, and `tsc --noEmit` on both front and back.
  - **Unit Tests**: Run frontend unit tests (Vitest) and backend tests (bun:test) on each push/PR. Gate merging on 90%+ coverage.
  - **Build & Integration Tests**: On main branch or tags, build Docker images. Run a containerized test suite (seed a test DB, then run E2E tests with Playwright against a staging deploy or dockerized stack).
  - **Security Scans**: Use GitHub’s code scanning and Dependabot for vulnerabilities. Possibly integrate Snyk or similar for extra safety.
  - **Deploy**: Auto-deploy on merge to main (or on tag). We’ll publish Docker images to a registry (Docker Hub or GitHub Packages). Deployment target: initially a free-tier host (e.g. Fly.io, Render.com, or even just a VPS). TanStack Start can deploy anywhere Node runs, and Elysia can run on any Linux host. We might start on Heroku free dynos or Railway’s free tier.
- **Rollbacks**: Keep the pipeline capable of rolling back to a previous image if a deploy fails (GitHub Actions can track releases).
- **Deployment Strategy**: Prefer Kubernetes or managed container when scaling (e.g. Amazon EKS, Google GKE, or simpler Docker Swarm). If budget is zero, use Render/Railway’s free tier with 1-2 instances, or Vercel for frontend plus Fly.io for backend. Over time, move to a robust platform. Use health checks and 95+% uptime setups.
- **Environment Management**: Use separate environments (dev, staging, prod) with their own DB and secrets. Manage config via environment variables (TanStack Start supports `.env` out-of-box). Secrets (JWT keys, DB passwords) stored in GitHub secrets and pulled in CI.
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Integrate application monitoring (e.g. Prometheus + Grafana) for performance metrics, and error tracking (Sentry) for exceptions. For product analytics (user behaviour), embed a privacy-conscious tool like PostHog. This informs UI improvements (e.g. which features are used).

## Testing Strategy

Testing must cover all layers:

- **Unit Testing**: As mentioned, use Vitest/Jest for React components and utilities, and Bun’s test runner for backend. Each new feature is accompanied by unit tests. Enforce TDD on critical components (auth flow, reporting calculations).
- **Integration Testing**: For backend, test API routes end-to-end using an in-memory or test PostgreSQL database. Elysia’s treaty allows writing type-safe tests easily. Frontend integration tests can use React Testing Library to simulate UI flows.
- **End-to-End (E2E)**: Use Playwright or Cypress to simulate real user scenarios in a deployed (or staging) environment. Example flows: user signup/login, create test case, run test suite, view report. Automate these in CI for regression.
- **Performance Testing**: Use tools like k6 or JMeter to simulate load (hundreds of concurrent users) on the API and web app, ensuring the system scales and tuning as needed.
- **Security Testing**: Include automated vulnerability scanning (e.g. OWASP ZAP) against the running app in CI. Regularly review third-party dependencies. Ensure secrets/config are not exposed in code.

Every code merge goes through PR review with mandatory approvals. The CI pipeline enforces testing on every commit, so broken tests block merges. We keep high coverage for critical modules.

## Security and Compliance

Security is paramount for enterprise software:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Enforce strong authentication (OAuth2, SSO integration for enterprise accounts) and per-user or per-project RBAC. The backend will check permissions on every sensitive action. This satisfies “role-based access control” and data security.
- **Data Protection**: All traffic over HTTPS. Encrypt sensitive fields in the database if needed. Use secure cookies or tokens with short TTL.
- **Audit Logging**: Log all admin actions (user invites, permission changes, deletions) and expose a read-only audit log for compliance officers. Version database migrations and keep track of schema changes.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: If targeting sectors like finance/healthcare, design the architecture to meet relevant standards (e.g. GDPR for EU/UK, SOC2/HIPAA controls). This might include data export tools, data minimization, and consent logging.
- **Infrastructure Security**: Regularly patch OS, use firewalls/security groups. If in Kubernetes, use network policies. Disable directory listing, default accounts. Protect against common web attacks (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection). Many of these are mitigated by using up-to-date libraries (TypeORM/Drizzle for safe queries, input validation in Elysia, React escaping output by default).

Throughout development, we will use code scanning (GitHub Advanced Security) and dependency checks (Dependabot/Snyk). The TestForge UI itself will be reviewed for accessibility (WCAG) and cross-browser support.

## Roadmap & Scaling Strategy

- **MVP (v1.0)**: Core functionality – user authentication, project/test-case CRUD, test execution logs, basic dashboards. Support manual and simple automated test results. Single-tenant for now.
- **v2**: Add integrations (GitHub/Jira), advanced reporting (custom dashboards), role management, templated workflows. Begin building AI features (simple auto-test suggestions).
- **v3**: Enterprise polish – multi-project and multi-tenant support, SSO, audit logs, fine-grained permissions. Containerized deployment automation (Helm charts/K8s). Real-time collaboration (WebSockets for live updates on test runs).
- **v4+**: AI-driven capabilities (fully automated test generation, NLP-based search). Plugin ecosystem. Mobile-friendly UI. Performance optimizations for large datasets (sharding DB, query tuning).

At each phase, gather feedback from pilot users. Use Agile sprints (2–3 weeks) with continuous delivery. Prioritise features that maximise impact (as metrics like Defect Detection Efficiency and pass rates improve).

**Scaling**: As usage grows, we scale horizontally. Database can scale (read replicas, partitioning). The stateless nature of the app means more front/back instances can be added behind a load balancer. Using open-source and cloud-native tools keeps costs down. We can leverage CI/CD to auto-scale or add shards when user count crosses thresholds.

By following this plan – a comprehensive PRD and a robust technical architecture – TestForge will meet and exceed what enterprises expect from a QA test management system. We build on established practices while introducing innovations that set our UX and features apart. All development steps (tests, CI, observability, security) are baked in from day one, ensuring a quality, scalable product that can evolve into the market’s leading test management solution.
