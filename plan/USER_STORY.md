# TestForge — Core User Story

## Persona

- **Name**: Sarah
- **Role**: QA Lead
- **Company**: Fintech company with 40 engineers and 8 QA engineers
- **Goal**: Ensure every feature release is tested properly before production.

---

## Scenario 1 — Creating a Test Plan

### Context

- A new feature is ready for QA.
- Developers have pushed code to staging.
- Sarah needs to create a test cycle for the release.

### Workflow

**Step 1 — Login**
Sarah logs into TestForge. She lands on a dashboard showing:

- Active Test Cycles
- Release Quality Score
- Flaky Test Alerts
- Team Execution Progress
- Defect Trends

**Step 2 — Create Test Cycle**
She clicks **New Test Cycle** and enters:

- **Name**: Checkout Payment Release
- **Environment**: Staging
- **Sprint**: Sprint 34
- **Start Date**: March 10
- **End Date**: March 14

Then she links:

- GitHub PR
- Jira Epic
- Product Requirement

TestForge automatically pulls related tickets.

---

## Scenario 2 — Creating Test Cases

Sarah now adds tests. She clicks **Generate Tests from Requirement**.

TestForge AI suggests tests:

1. Successful card payment
2. Payment decline scenario
3. Network failure retry
4. Double payment prevention
5. Invalid card number validation

She selects them, and the system auto-creates structured test cases. Each test case includes:

- Title
- Steps
- Expected Result
- Priority
- Tags
- Component
- Automation Status

**Example:**

- **Title**: Successful Payment with Valid Visa Card
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to checkout
  2. Enter valid Visa card
  3. Confirm payment
- **Expected result**: Payment successful and order confirmed

---

## Scenario 3 — Assigning Tests

Sarah assigns tests to team members.

**Example**:

- Test Case 1 → David
- Test Case 2 → Aisha
- Test Case 3 → Mark

The testers receive notifications.

---

## Scenario 4 — Executing Tests

David logs into TestForge. He opens **Test Cycle → Checkout Payment Release**.

He sees a beautiful execution interface. Instead of ugly spreadsheets (like other tools), TestForge shows:

- Test Step
- Expected Result
- Execution Status
- Notes
- Attachment

David runs the test. He selects **PASS** or **FAIL**.

If it fails, he clicks **Create Bug**. TestForge automatically sends the bug to Jira, GitHub issues, or Linear, with:

- Steps
- Logs
- Screenshots
- Environment

---

## Scenario 5 — Test Analytics

Sarah opens the **Release Dashboard**. She sees:

- **Total Tests**: 120
- **Passed**: 90
- **Failed**: 20
- **Blocked**: 10
- **Coverage**: 87%

Charts show:

- Defect density
- Risk areas
- Flaky tests
- Test execution velocity

The system highlights:

> ⚠️ **Payment service has high failure rate**

---

## Scenario 6 — CI/CD Integration

When developers push new code:

- CI pipeline runs automated tests.
- TestForge receives results automatically.
- Dashboard updates instantly.

---

## Scenario 7 — Release Decision

Before production release Sarah opens the **Release Quality Score**.

TestForge calculates:

- Test Coverage
- Defect Severity
- Automation Coverage
- Flaky Test Rate

It outputs:

- **Release Confidence Score**: 92%
- **Recommendation**: SAFE TO RELEASE

---

## Scenario 8 — Traceability

Later an auditor asks: _"Was requirement X tested?"_

Sarah opens **Requirement → Linked Tests → Execution Results → Bugs**.
Full traceability appears.

---

## Scenario 9 — AI Assistance

TestForge AI helps QA engineers. Examples:

1. **Generate tests**: Generate tests from a user story.
2. **Detect flaky tests**: _"This test failed 4 times randomly. Likely flaky."_
3. **Suggest missing coverage**: _"Payment refund scenario not tested."_

---

## Scenario 10 — Collaboration

Team members can comment inside test cases.

**Example**:

> **Developer**: _"This scenario is not possible due to validation."_

QA updates the test based on the comment.

---

## Why TestForge Will Be Unique

Most tools like TestRail, Zephyr, and qTest feel like Excel spreadsheets. TestForge will feel like **Notion + Linear + GitHub + Figma level UX**.

### Key UX innovations:

1. **Beautiful Test Execution UI**: Instead of tables, use interactive step cards.
2. **AI Test Generation**: From requirements, PRs, or user stories.
3. **Release Confidence Score**: A unique feature. Companies love decision dashboards.
4. **Real-time CI/CD Integration**: Live updates.
5. **Flaky Test Intelligence**: Many companies struggle with this.
6. **Visual Test Coverage**: Graph of Feature → Tests → Results.
